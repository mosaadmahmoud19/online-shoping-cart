The Online Shop Management System is a C++ project that showcases my proficiency in object-oriented programming and software development. In this project, I implemented a simulated e-commerce platform with user registration, product management, shopping cart functionality, and payment processing.

As the main developer, I designed various classes, including Address, User, Product, ProductList, ShoppingCart, and Payment, to encapsulate different functionalities. The User class served as a base class, inherited by the Administrator and Customer classes, which facilitated code reuse and modularity.

I successfully implemented features such as user registration, where users can sign up as administrators or customers, providing their personal and address details. Administrators have the authority to manage the product list, enabling them to add or remove products from the inventory.

For customers, I implemented a shopping cart that allows them to browse products, add items to the cart, and calculate the total price of the selected products. The shopping cart also provides options to remove products, ensuring a smooth shopping experience.

Additionally, I integrated a Payment class, offering payment methods like credit card, online banking, and cash on delivery. Customers can choose their preferred payment method and complete their purchases securely.

The entire project is developed with a user-friendly console interface, providing an intuitive user experience. The main menu presents users with clear options, creating a seamless interaction flow.

In conclusion, the Online Shop Management System demonstrates my ability to design and implement complex software systems using C++ and object-oriented programming principles. This project showcases my skills in software architecture, data management, and user interface design. As a dedicated software developer, I have honed my problem-solving and coding abilities through this project, and I am excited to apply these skills to future software development challenges.
